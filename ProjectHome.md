Lagniappe based Replicated State Machine

- Throughput of existing BFT RSMs reduces drastically in presence of byzantine faults. Even a single faulty node can render the system unusable.

- Aardvark is a new BFT protocol which aims to provide high performance in presence of faults by optimizing the cases where Byzantine faults are common.

- Combining ideas of Aardvark with Lagniappe would yield a better performant system in presence of Byzantine faults.
